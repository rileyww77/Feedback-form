# Project Name

Prime Feedback Form

## Description

This application provides a form for students to provide daily feedback for the program. Each question is displayed on a different page, with all the answers displayed at the end. Students must fill out every input (except for an option comment) to proceed to the next page. On submit, the responses get sent to the database for processing later.
